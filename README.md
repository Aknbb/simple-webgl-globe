# Simple WebGL Globe

This is a simple web application that uses WebGL to render a basic 3D globe, allowing panning and zooming functionalities. The purpose of this project is to understand the workings of WebGL, learn about texture usage, and implement fundamental features to create a basic 3D world map.

### Demo

![Demo](docs/demo.webp)

### Features

* **Basic 3D Globe**: Utilizes WebGL to render a simple 3D representation of the Earth.

* **Pan**: Navigate around the globe by clicking and dragging.

* **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

### Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the simple-webgl-globe repository from GitHub:**

    ```
       git clone https://github.com/Aknbb/simple-webgl-globe.git
    ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.**

### Purpose
This project serves as a learning exercise to gain insights into WebGL's functionality, understand texture usage, and implement basic 3D mapping capabilities. The focus is on keeping the complexity minimal for better comprehension.
